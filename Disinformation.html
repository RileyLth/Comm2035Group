		<h1><u>DISINFOMATION</u></h1><br><br>
		<h2>Definition</h2>
		<p>The meaning of disinformation is different from misinformation. Misinformation is mainly describing the status of the information, which is inaccurate information. However, disinformation is an action. It is about giving out the false information which is intended to lie to the audience, or mislead the true information. The action of disinformation is mainly used in certain areas, specifically in politics. Using the most recent election of Taiwan president as one of the examples, it is known that the media environment in Taiwan is not good. Couple of media companies have been found out that they have some political party background. Since then they give out some misleading information to the audience to affect their rival competitor. </p>
		<br>
		<h2>Example</h2>
		<p>According to the BBC, a month before the 2024 election of Taiwan President, Ko Wen-Je suddenly faced charges of Organ trade without any evidence. It is believed that the charges are used to disinformation the citizens.</p>
