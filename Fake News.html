		<h1><u>FAKE NEWS</u></h1><br><br>
		<h2>Definition</h2>
		<p>Fake news is one kind of disinformation. As the name has spoken, the medium of this kind disinformation is news. The conversation of fake news has been raised in these years, due to the rise of social media. Particularly, the rise of the self media. Since, the threshold of becoming a self media in social media is much lower than becoming a traditional media. This encourages some of the users to become self media. However, these kind users may not have the ability to determine what kind of information they should or should not post. Also, not only the self media, some of the traditional media may also touch the gray area between their industry ethics and fake news. Since they want to earn the money of the advertising revenue, they will make some really dramatic news headlines to attract audiences to click in. This kind of action will lead to giving the wrong information which is misinformation.</p>

		<h2>Example</h2>
		<p>In 2017, Alex Jones from Info wars reported a Hurricane, Irma is coming which is a category six storm. However, there is no such thing called category six storms. The maximum category of storms are five.</p>
