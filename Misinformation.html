		<h1><u>MISINFORMATION</u></h1><br><br>
		<h2>Definition</h2>
		<p>The definition of misinformation is false or misleading information. The word “misinformation” mainly refers to the information itself, not describing an action. For example: Person A received information, and he told the information to person B. However, during the process of A giving out the information to B, A unconsciously said something wrong about the information. This makes the information from now on become misinformation. However, we don’t consider the action by A to be defined as disinformation. Since he is not intended to give out the wrong information to B.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Example</h2>
		<p>In 2011, Asia TV reported that Jiang Zemin (1926-2022) died because of heart issues. However, Jiang Zemin was still alive at that time. “Jiang Zemin died because of heart issues.” is a misinformation.</p>
