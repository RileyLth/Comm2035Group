          <h1> <u> About Us</u> </h1>
          <br> 
          <p> Our firm was founded at the beginning of 2019 and we wish 
              to provide trustworthy information to help people to
             distinguish between true and fake information. Our
              goal as a group of three is to spread truth via
               the internet to the wider community.
               <br> <br>
            We know how important it is to have correct information 
            in the current digital environment. Upholding the truth and
             honesty is what we whish. Our mission is to dispel false information by 
             giving information on how we can know if the information is fake or not.
            <br> <br>
            The foundation of our group is education. We offer useful 
            guides, such as examples, videos, and external website, 
            to improve media literacy and enable users  to 
            confidently navigate through the internet.
            <br> <br>
            The values of our groups are independence, responsibility, and
             transparency. We also values our users and will adapt the constructive
              critisism from our users to build a better website, and more importantly,
              a kind and harmonious community.
             <br> <br>
            Please come along with us in this era of internet, lets explore the wonderful internet
              with more confidence and the ability to distinguish what to believe and what not to believe.
